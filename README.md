# so_long

This is a simple 2D game written in C using the MiniLibX library and my custom Libft library, which contains implementations of most standard C library functions. All the memory that used in the program is dynamically allocated and the program is also responsible for deallocating memory to ensure efficient resource management. The game uses .ber type maps. The game verifies the provided map file to ensure the presence of a valid path for gameplay and, upon confirmation, proceeds to conclude the game.
